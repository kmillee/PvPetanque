  pageText: "The first team to play is designated randomly. \n\nThey get to throw
    to cochonnet on the field and start with the first shot.\n\n\nThen, the opposing
    team shoots their first ball and tries to get as close to the cochonnet as possible
    (or to move the opponent\u2019s ball away).\n\nFrom these two first shots, the
    next playing team depends on whose ball is the closest from the goal :\n\nIf
    the closest ball was thrown by team A, then team B shoots the next one, and will
    shoot as long as team A is the closest to goal (and as long as team B has balls
    left to throw). \n\nThe moment team B takes the lead (is closer to the goal),
    then team A gets to shoot and so on.\r\n\n\nWhen one of the teams has eventually
    thrown all of their balls, the opponent team gets to throw their remaining ones.\r\n\n\nWhen
    all 12 total balls have been thrown, we count the point of the round.\n\nOnly
    the team that is leading (owns the closest ball to the goal) gets to win points.\n\nThey
    will get a point for each ball they have closer to the goal than their opponents."
